        <p>I used a URL shortening service <strong><em><a href="https://app.rebrandly.com">Rebrandly URL Shortener API</a></em></strong> to create an application.</p>
        <p>In order to use the functionality of the app Enter the URL into the input field, and click the shorten button in the web page.</p>

    <div>
        <p>The application is a part of the study series and has been created only for learning purposes. The aim of this exercise is to create an AJAX request and refactoring the code in the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have incorporated the boilerplate code for an AJAX 'POST' request using XMLHttpRequest object.</li>
            <li>Next, to simplify and improve the code of the request, I use fetch(), which uses promises to handle requests. To make asynchronous event handling easier, promises were introduced in JavaScript in ES6.</li>
            <li>The last step of the code refactoring would be to simplify requests using <strong><em>async</em></strong> and <strong><em>await</em></strong>.</li>
        </ul>

    <p><strong>What is this app exectly?</strong></p>
    <p><em>A URL shortener is a service that generates a unique short URL, usually around ~10 characters long, which is mapped to a longer URL and leads to the same destination as the longer URL. The information is typically stored in a table or hash map in key-value pairs, where keys are the short URL, and the values are the original, longer URL.</em> <strong>~codeacademy</strong></p>
